h2. Introduction

This is a fork of http://github.com/alexyoung/ico/tree. It adds hover effects and information and stacked area charts to the library, amongst a host of other things.

This version still supports all of the original graphs and api options, check the original readme for more information

h3. new options
* Area charts
* Stacked area charts and stacked line charts
* Interactivity through hoverable items to display additional information, and give them a different colour on hover
* Allow the last item of (horizontal) bar charts and spark bars to be a different colour
* Ability to add watermarks via a link to an image or an image element
* Watermark can be placed in the middle of the graph or the lower right corner
* Add units (such as %) to the vertical axis values (or horizontal in the case of a horizontal bar chart)
* Horizontal bar charts can now have a rounded ending
* Linegraphs have an API option that allows them to start at a non-zero horizontal position
* API option to hide grid lines if there is no label associated with that value
