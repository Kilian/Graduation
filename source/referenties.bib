This result shows that perceived control was related more to personal psychological aspects than social correlates.  This finding implies that an individual's perception of the responsiveness of a communication medium can be influenced by the social surroundings consisting of others with whom s/he communicates socially. NFC also plays a large part  we may infer that people with a higher level of NFC and those who spend more time using the Web tend to think online social interaction with others is more doable and comfortable.  Social networks and participation should be placed in the larger perspective of long-term social interactions and is introduces as if it were to groups, not individuals  Sundar (2004) points out that perceived interactivity is confounded with perceived usability.
